# WonderSwan CPU Test V0.0.1 (20220517)

This is a CPU Test program for Bandai WonderSwan (Color/Crystal) & PocketChallenge V2.

## How to use:

Load the ROM in an emulator or flash it to a flashcart and put it in your WonderSwan.
The program will go through all the tests and then write "Ok".
If run in an emulator and it doesn't emulate the WonderSwan CPU correctly,
the program will stop at the first failure and print out expected value/flags
and the 
Now you can use the X1-X4 to navigate the menus, A to select an option,
B to go back.

## Building:
	I use nasm https://nasm.us/ by running "nasm -f bin -o WSCpuTest.wsc WSCpuTest.asm".

## How do the undefine flags / undocumented op-codes work?

### AND, OR & XOR
AuxCarry, Carry & Overflow are always cleared.
Sign, Zero & Parity are set according to result.

### Mul
Mulu/Muls/IMul change all the undefined flags.
AuxCarry, Parity & Sign are always cleared.
Zero is always set.
Carry & Overflow is set if the result doesn't fit in 8 bits for 8bit multiplies.

### Div

### AAM / CVTBD
The AAM op-code is a 2 byte op-code, and the second byte can be any value not just 10.
So it's basically a byte by byte divide.

### AAD / CVTDB
The AAD op-code just as the AAM op-code is a 2 byte op-code, and the second byte can be any value not just 10. So this is a byte by byte multiplication plus byte addition. The answear is only in AL
and AH is allways zero. Flags are calculated only from the add after the multiplication, the flags are exactly like a normal add.

### DAA / ADJ4A

### DAS / ADJ4S

### Push SP to stack
8086/80186
{
	SP      = SP - 2
	[SS:SP] = SP
}

## Controls:
Use WS X1-X4 to navigate the menus. A to select, B to go back.
